Custom made Canvas Projects

Here i have some creative custom made projects that i learned in Youtube with the canvas elements.
all the codes used for this effects are coded **without** a library

# Discription

The canvas element is part of HTML5 and allows for dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D shapes and bitmap images. It is a low level, procedural model that updates a bitmap.
with the help of canvas element and javaScript and object oriented programming we can make and style Particles or even pixels to make creative effects
