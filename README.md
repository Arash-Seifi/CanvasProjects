# CanvasProjects
Custom made Canvas Projects

Here i have some creative custom made projects that i learned in Youtube with the canvas elements.
all the codes used for this effects are coded **without** a library

# Discription

The canvas element is part of HTML5 and allows for dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D shapes and bitmap images. It is a low level, procedural model that updates a bitmap.
with the help of canvas element and javaScript and object oriented programming we can make and style Particles or even pixels to make creative effects


**Note: if you are interested in learning more about canvas you can visit this channel, it is very clear and he explaines everything from the groundup so you dont need to know much about JavaScript or canvas to begin with. so make sure to visit his channel for more content https://www.youtube.com/c/Frankslaboratory.
